    Born and raised in Littleton, Colorado. I am a Colorado native and I take full
    advantage of everything this wonderful state has to offer.
    <br>
    <br>
    I remember being introduced to
    HTML back in grade school and having a difficult time learning it. Never would
    I have thought back then that I would doing it as a career. I am very excited to
    have the opportunity to be part of this program.

    <p class="one_third">
      I am an active snowboarder and sometimes you will see me ski. I love to camp,
      back-pack, back-country ski, raft, snowmobile, and dive. I jumped out of an airplane for the first time last year,
      and I am looking to become certified as soon as I start making money again.
      <br>
      <br>
      I also love to travel, as it opens up the ability explore and learn different cultures.
    </p>
    <p class="one_third">
      I graduated from the University of Colorado, Boulder in 2011.
      B.A. Economics. While in school I worked at the Boulder Country Club and also
      sold snowboards at the second largest ski shop in Colorado.

      After graduation I went to work for Leanin' Tree Greeting Cards as a National Account
      Representative and recently resigned from my position to start this program.

    <p>I completed a course through <em> Galvanize </em>&ldquo;Zero to Web Development&rdquo;
        in early 2016 which sparked my interest in all that could be done, created, and
        developed.
        <br>
        <br>
        My ultimate goal is to graduate with a certification that sets me up for success in the future. With this
        program it will provide me with a strong base to continue educating myself. I have found a passion for
        coding and it is a career change that I am extremely excited for. I want a career that allows me to
        continue to grow. A career that gives me not just another job, but a lifetime of learning and innovating.

        <br>
        <br>
        I want to use these skills to create a mentally stimulating career. A career that challenges me, because I
        can overcome these challenges. I have never been so
        excited to join the community and put my drive, passion, and skills into everything I do. I truly want to
        be part of a startup company. With my strong work ethic, teamwork skills, adaptability, and drive I
        would be a perfect asset.</p>

        <p>&ldquo;The key is finding a passion for what you do. Just be passionate about the
          problem that you are solving, why you are solving it, and the potential of
          solution. When you build a business, you're are in it for the long haul and
          if you're not passionate about what you do, you'll give up for all the wrong
          reasons &rdquo;</p>
